#ChurnEngine

Introduction: 

A relatively low-level engine for creating simple videogames. A project designed to help myself understand the underlying processes and works of a video game engine, and eventually to be used to create my own video games. 

The Churn engine is based on TheChernos old game-engine series called the Sparky engine, hence the name Churn. I decided to go with the Sparky engine over the Hazel engine, as I think Hazel is extended quite a bit over my intended scope. 

I will however try make extensions and differences between the Churn engine and the Sparky engine, as the goal is to learn, not copy. 

Installation: 

Churn as of now has no release builds, but will hopefully in the future have a release of some sort. One thing I can say is Churn is sourced and built on Ubuntu, so compiling is done through CMAKE. Ideally in the future you will just be able to clone the repo, build and then make. The reason for this is quite similar to why I went with Sparky over Hazel, as I want to stick to the basics, and I do not want compiling and so on to be "au

Goals: 

The end goal is to feel more confident in creating what i deem to be large scale projects in general. ALso more experience in C++ in general, along with the perks and cons that come with like how to incorporate external libraries, how to use cmake and how to scale C++ projects. Obviously a better understanding of video games and how they work is also a goal. 

A more conrete goal and a way to measure this would be to one day participate in a Game Jam using this very engine, and create a project I am proud of.
